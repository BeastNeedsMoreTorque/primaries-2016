/**
 * A candidate and its group of dots.
 *
 * Each dot will animate from its start position to its end one.
 *
 * The animation is: we give each point its own Cubic BÃ©zier curve. For each
 * frame we place each point along the line (with one `t` value, which makes the
 * math quick), but then we "pull" the closest points more quickly than the
 * farthest point, so they don't all complete at the same time. We time it such
 * that at t=0.5, the first point is already complete (so we're pulling them all
 * by half the distance to the closest one).
 *
 * @param candidate_id Candidate ID String
 * @param target_xy { x, y } in the <canvas> where all these dots will go
 * @param dots Array of { x, y } dot start positions
 * @param max_n_dots Maximum `dots.length` across all candidates. We use this
 *                   so a candidate with fewer dots will complete its animation
 *                   before t=1; the "winner" animates longer than the "losers"
