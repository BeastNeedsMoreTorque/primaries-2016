state: IA
party: Dem
text: Hillary Clinton has enjoyed a lead in the Iowa caucus polls, but Bernie Sanders has steadily closed that gap over the last few months. Some show Clinton with a clear lead, but others show the candidates in a close race. HuffPost Pollster’s average gives Clinton a narrow lead. Stay tuned -- this one could be a nail-biter.
:end


state: IA
party: GOP
text: The Republican contest in Iowa has seen a few candidates surge and fall, but headed into the caucus it’s Ted Cruz who is giving Donald Trump a run for his money. Polls are waffling about which one is ahead, and HuffPost Pollster’s average has them practically tied. But don’t dismiss Marco Rubio. He’s solidly in third place, according to the polls. All other candidates are averaging single digits.
