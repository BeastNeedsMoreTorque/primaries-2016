hed: Why Vote Counts And Delegate Counts Don’t Always Match
pubbed_dt: Thursday, Jan. 28, 11:04 AM EST
body_markdown:


In the primaries, each contender aims for the most _delegates_, not the most _votes_.


A _delegate_ is a person who will attend the Democratic or Republican National Convention in July. Each delegate will vote for a presidential candidate.


### How are delegates chosen?


When you vote in a primary or caucus, you’re helping to select a _pledged_ delegate. Pledged delegates have promised to vote for a specific candidate in the convention.


The rules that translate votes into delegates vary by party and state.


Some rules are simple: All Republican delegates in Florida will be pledged to the candidate who gets the most votes.


Other rules are indirect: Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa select people to attend county conventions; county conventions select people to attend district conventions; district conventions select people to attend the state convention; and the _state_ convention selects pledged delegates. (OK, if that wasn’t confusing enough: The district conventions select some pledged delegates, too.) The process takes four and a half months.


In short: The pledged delegate allocation doesn’t always mirror the vote count.


Then there are _unpledged_ delegates (so-called “super-delegates”). They’re usually party leaders and elected officials. They will vote for the presidential candidate _they_ choose, regardless of the outcome of their state’s primary or caucus.


### Which delegate counts does The Huffington Post report?


We report estimates from the Associated Press.


The AP counts _pledged_ delegates when a party reports them. If there’s a vote tally and the party hasn’t published its list of pledged delegates, the AP may make a prediction.

The AP counts _unpledged_ delegates when they declare, on the record, that they will vote for a candidate.


We report the sum of the pledged and unpledged delegates in the totals at the top of the page.

Set over to true when AP flags the race as completed. Normally we mark a race “over” when 100% of precincts are reporting, but sometimes 100% don’t report and we want to stop declaring we’re doing live updates.
