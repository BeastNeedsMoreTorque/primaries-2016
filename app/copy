hed: Why vote counts and delegate counts don’t always match
body_markdown:
In the primaries, each contender aims for the most _delegates_, not the most _votes_.


A _delegate_ is a person who will attend the Democratic or Republican National Convention in July. Each delegate will vote for a presidential candidate.


### Who becomes a delegate?


When you vote in a primary or caucus, you’re helping to select a _pledged_ delegate. Pledged delegates have promised to vote for a specific candidate in the convention.


The rules that translate votes into delegates vary by party and state.


Some rules are simple: Republican delegates in Florida will all be pledged to the candidate who gets the most votes.


Other rules are indirect: Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa select people to attend county conventions; county conventions select people to attend district conventions; district conventions select people to attend the state convention; and the _state_ convention selects pledged delegates. (Okay, that wasn’t confusing enough: the district conventions select some pledged delegates, too.) The process takes four and a half months.


In short: pledged delegate counts usually relate to vote counts, more or less.


Then there are _unpledged_ delegates (so-called “super-delegates”). They’re usually party leaders and elected officials. They will vote for the presidential candidate _they_ choose, regardless of the outcomes of their states’ primaries.


### What delegate counts does Huffington Post report?


We report estimates from the Associated Press.


We count _pledged_ delegates when a party reports them. But if a vote has happened and the party hasn’t given any official results yet, we may report a prediction based on the vote result and party rules.


We count _unpledged_ delegates when they declare, on the record, that they will vote for a candidate.


We report the sum.

state: IA
party: Dem
text: Hillary Clinton has enjoyed a lead in the Iowa caucus polls, but Bernie Sanders has steadily closed that gap over the last few months. Some show Clinton with a clear lead, but others show the candidates in a close race. HuffPost Pollster’s average gives Clinton a narrow lead. Stay tuned -- this one could be a nail-biter.

state: IA
party: GOP
text: The Republican contest in Iowa has seen a few candidates surge and fall, but headed into the caucus it’s Ted Cruz who is giving Donald Trump a run for his money. Trump is ahead in the HuffPost Pollster average, but the race is still tight.. But don’t dismiss Marco Rubio. He’s solidly in third place, according to the polls. All other candidates are averaging single digits.
