hed: Why vote counts and delegate counts don’t always match
body:
If you’re reading this, you’re probably wondering why a candidate got lots of votes and few delegates (or the other way around).


It’s complicated.


First let’s be clear about what a delegate _is_. A delegate is a person who will attend the Democratic National Convention or Republican National Convention. Both conventions are in July 2016. Each delegate will vote for a presidential candidate.


Who becomes a delegate?


Each party in each state chooses _pledged_ and _unpledged_ delegates.


If you vote in a primary or caucus, you’re helping to select a _pledged_ delegate. Votes are treated differently by each party in each state. Some are simple: Republican delegates in Florida will all be pledged to the candidate who gets the most votes. Others are indirect: Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa will decide (by standing in the right place) who will attend the county conventions; those people vote for representatives in the district conventions; _those_ representatives choose _some_ delegates, and they also choose representatives to the state-level convention to choose the rest.


s are chosen by voters. Each pledges to vote for a particular presidential candidate at the convention.


Voting rules for pledged delegates vary by state. 


_Unpledged_ delegates (so-called “super-delegates”) are usually party leaders and elected officials who get an automatic ticket to the convention. They will vote for the presidential candidate _they_ choose, regardless of how the party voted in their state.






Nationally, Democrats and Republicans set a few rules. They tell each state how many delegates.

state: IA
party: Dem
text: Hillary Clinton has enjoyed a lead in the Iowa caucus polls, but Bernie Sanders has steadily closed that gap over the last few months. Some show Clinton with a clear lead, but others show the candidates in a close race. HuffPost Pollster’s average gives Clinton a narrow lead. Stay tuned -- this one could be a nail-biter.
:end


state: IA
party: GOP
text: The Republican contest in Iowa has seen a few candidates surge and fall, but headed into the caucus it’s Ted Cruz who is giving Donald Trump a run for his money. Polls are waffling about which one is ahead, and HuffPost Pollster’s average has them practically tied. But don’t dismiss Marco Rubio. He’s solidly in third place, according to the polls. All other candidates are averaging single digits.
